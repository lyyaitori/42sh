# 42sh

First year EPITECH's end-year project (Unix System Programming)

========================

This project was only made by me and passed as ***67%*** so:

- Pick up a solid group and use this project as a base (but beware of the -42)
- Some techniques I used may be useless as I speeded up to write it
- Based on TCSH Shell as requiered
- There should be no memleaks
- etc.

Hope it can turn out to be useful for some y'all
